> This podcast was released 09/08/2021 as part of the Polyglot Podcast - a series from The New Relic Relicans - both the series and team that created it have been dismantled. It was so much fun while it lasted, and I've recovered as much as possible from the Internet Archive.

> Huge Thanks to [Mandy Moore](https://mandymoore.tech/) who produced, edited, and put untold hours into this podcast. Without her work, the transcripts below (and episodes themselves) wouldn't have existed.

## Teasers

> Dmitry: We've been trying to deliver APIs based on some back-of-the-napkin descriptions, based on sketches, wireframes, instead of basing our implementation on solid, concrete mockups.
