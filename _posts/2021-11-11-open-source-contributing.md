Most folks get stuck in open-source on one of the three following barriers:
* Getting Started
* Building the PR on a Forked Repo
* Managing feelings around the review process

I want to remove those barriers for you, and give you a realistic view of how to contribute to open-source projects, and get your PRs merged.

### References

I don't recommend picking an issue based on it being a "Good First Issue" but these sites are good to identify your "Good First Repo".
- [Good First Issue](https://goodfirstissue.dev/)
- [Good First Issues](https://goodfirstissues.com/)

Here are a few of the PRs I've worked on that I mentioned in my talk.
- [ComparisonValidator](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/40095) is a nice example of extending functionality.
- [Documentation](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/42074/files) is hard, but always needed. Here's [documentation](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/43018) explaining how Rails's `order` works.
- Let's add [Liquid Tags](https://github.com/forem/forem/pull/10577) to Forem! This taught me about Liquid tags so I was ready for [Jekyll-Twitch.](https://github.com/ChaelCodes/jekyll-twitch)
- [Unloved PR](https://github.com/ChaelCodes/BlaysModsDocs) that taught me about Forked Repos.
- [CASA](https://github.com/rubyforgood/casa/pull/1998) has small focused issues. This leads to small [PRs](https://github.com/rubyforgood/casa/pull/2001).

Here are a few Ruby Repos I mentioned and recommend.
- [CASA](https://github.com/rubyforgood/casa) is a Ruby For Good Rails app that organizes volunteers for foster youth. They have GREAT issues, amazing response time, and are incredibly welcoming.
- [ConfBuddies](https://github.com/ChaelCodes/ConfBuddies) is a Rails app that helps you attend conferences with your friends! I'm the maintainer, so if you need a friendly face, this is a good place to start.
- [Forem](https://github.com/forem/forem), the platform supporting Dev.To and CodeNewbies, has a welcoming community, and are incredibly responsive to new PRs, however, I've had issues with their Docker dev setup.
- [Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails) is a web application framework in Ruby. I'm not going to lie to you. Getting a PR merged here is challenging. There's a lot of feedback, a lot of contributors, and not a lot of maintainers. But you can have a lot of impact.
- [Jekyll-Twitch](https://github.com/ChaelCodes/jekyll-twitch) was mentioned, but is actually feature complete. You can make your own gem though!
