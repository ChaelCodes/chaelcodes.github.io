In this [Dead Code](https://deadcode.website){:target="_blank"} podcast episode, Jared Norman interviews Chael Wright-Munn (ChaelCodes) about the benefits of working openly through activities like live streaming and contributing to open-source projects. Chael emphasizes how creating a "library of examples" through public coding can enhance a developerâ€™s skills, build their professional network, and preserve their achievements beyond their current job. She offers practical advice on starting a stream, such as using OBS software, focusing on community building, and engaging in structured projects like Hacktoberfest. The discussion highlights the value of maintaining a visible presence in the tech community, whether through streaming, open-source contributions, or other public-facing efforts, as a way to retain knowledge and showcase work, even across job changes.
