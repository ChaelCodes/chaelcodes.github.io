As a content creator, I love the look and feel of "link in bio" pages.
They're such an easy and mobile-friendly way to share various social medias and projects.
However, as a developer, I am frankly offended at the idea of needing a SAAS app to create a static page of links.
The idea of _paying_ for such a service, or sharing *my* page with their branding is simply abhorrent.
Thankfully I have a Jekyll site and the ability to create `<a>` tags, so I'm able to avoid that dismal fate.❤️
