<section id="intro">
    <p><strong>These gentle sitting exercises can be done at home and will help improve your mobility and prevent falls.</strong></p>
    <p>Do not worry if you have not done much exercise for a while, these seated exercises are gentle and easy to follow.</p>
    <p>For these exercises, choose a solid, stable chair that does not have wheels.</p>
    <p>You should be able to sit with your feet flat on the floor and knees bent at right angles. Avoid chairs with arms, as these will restrict your movement.</p>
    <p>Wear loose, comfortable clothing and keep some water handy.</p>
    <p>Build up slowly and aim to gradually increase the repetitions of each exercise over time.</p>
    <p>Try to do these exercises at least twice a week and combine them with the other routines in this series:</p>
