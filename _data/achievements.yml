    One Dreamer is a beautiful programming game that I've been following since its prologue days.
    I was honored to have the opportunity to voice one of the NPCs.

  title: Your First Open-Source Contribution at RubyConf 2021
  content: <a href="/talks/2021/11/11/open-source-contributing.html">Your First Open-Source Contribution</a> was my first talk at RubyConf, and
    I was so excited to share what I've learned in my experiences diving into open-source, and share more from a maintainer's perspective.
    I really like that this talk dug into some concrete advice that often gets missed when talking about a first contribution.

  title: ComparisonValidator merged into Rails!
  content: I was ecstatic when <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/40095">ComparisonValidator</a> was merged into Rails!
    Before, it was surprisingly hard to valiidate that a start_date was before an end_date in Rails,
    which was the idea that seeded what would eventually become the ComparisonValidator.
    Huge thanks to MatthewD on this one, who encouraged me to submit a PR when I wasn't sure if the idea was worth pursuing,
    and redirected me away from some early bad designs. ðŸ§¡
